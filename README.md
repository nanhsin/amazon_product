# Amazon Product: Unpacking Brand Significance

## Motivation
This project is driven by the overarching goal of unraveling the intricacies that influence Amazon product pricing and ratings and providing invaluable insights to enhance the decision-making processes of Amazon and its sellers. In the pursuit of this objective, we draw inspiration from the insightful analysis conducted by Ivan Isaev’s Kaggle notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ivanisaev/mazon-dataset-discounts-eda). While Isaev's analysis provides valuable insights into the dynamics of discounts and brand names, this project aims to extend the analysis by incorporating crucial dimensions related to the brand of the products. Specifically, we seek to explore the influence of brands’ size, country, and other relevant factors on the pricing of Amazon products. Through a combination of descriptive, diagnostic (inferential), and predictive analytics, we aim to uncover nuanced patterns that transcend discount considerations, offering a deeper insight into the multifaceted factors driving sales in the competitive landscape of Amazon's e-commerce platform.
